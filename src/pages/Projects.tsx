      A user uploads a photo, the model will predict the chances of lesion being melanoma. 
      The goal of this project is to have the Tech Committee learn about how ML models are made and 
      how they can be integrated into web applications while also promoting people to take charge in their health and 
      raise awareness on the dangers of melanoma.`,
